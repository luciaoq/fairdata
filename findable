To be Findable:

F1. (meta)data are assigned a globally unique and eternally persistent identifier or PID
F2. data are described with rich metadata
F3. (meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource
F4. metadata specify the data identifier
Your institution’s/repository’s role:

Assign a globally unique PID upon publication (or draft upload)
Provide metadata schema in human- & machine-readable format (PID, author names, subject areas, etc)
Support structured input of metadata (submission forms or XML schema)
Index (meta)data to enable effective searching
Allow metadata upload & assign corresponding PID
Your role as a researcher:

Check datasets that you use for PIDs & cite them
Ensure that your datasets get published with PIDs
Choose repositories that automate PID registration
Report this requirement to repositories that don’t assign PIDs
Add rich metadata (describe the dataset’s context, quality, condition & characteristics)
Should be understandable by researchers from different disciplines (ask a friend to proofread)
